New interface! Import paths, class methods, and overall API structure will be different.

Old version (0.1.10) will no longer be supported.

New tutorials are available to help you migrate: Check them
out [here](https://github.com/sb-ai-lab/HypEx/tree/master/examples/tutorials).

Try the new version now by installing the beta release:

```
pip install --upgrade --pre hypex
```

Prefer the old version? You can still use it, but it won't receive updates:

```
pip install hypex==0.1.10
```

## Introduction

HypEx (Hypotheses and Experiments) is a comprehensive library crafted to streamline the causal inference and AB testing
processes in data analytics. Developed for efficiency and effectiveness, HypEx employs Rubin's Causal Model (RCM) for
matching closely related pairs, ensuring equitable group comparisons when estimating treatment effects.

Boasting a fully automated pipeline, HypEx adeptly calculates the Average Treatment Effect (ATE), Average Treatment
Effect on the Treated (ATT), and Average Treatment Effect on the Control (ATC). It offers a standardized interface for
executing these estimations, providing insights into the impact of interventions across various population subgroups.

Beyond causal inference, HypEx is equipped with robust AB testing tools, including Difference-in-Differences (
Diff-in-Diff) and CUPED methods, to rigorously test hypotheses and validate experimental results.

## Features

- **Faiss KNN Matching**: Utilizes Faiss for efficient and precise nearest neighbor searches, aligning with RCM for
  optimal pair matching.
- **Data Filters**: Built-in outlier and Spearman filters ensure data quality for matching.
- **Result Validation**: Offers multiple validation methods, including random treatment, feature, and subset
  validations.
- **Data Tests**: Incorporates SMD, KS, PSI, and Repeats tests to affirm the robustness of effect estimations.
- **Feature Selection**: Employs LGBM and Catboost feature selection to pinpoint the most impactful features for causal
  analysis.
- **AB Testing Suite**: Features a suite of AB testing tools for comprehensive hypothesis evaluation.
- **Stratification support**: Stratify groups for nuanced analysis
- **Weights support**:  Empower your analysis by assigning custom weights to features, enhancing the matching precision
  to suit your specific research needs

## Warnings

Some functions in HypEx can facilitate solving specific auxiliary tasks but cannot automate decisions on experiment
design. Below, we will discuss features that are implemented in HypEx but do not automate the design of experiments.

**Note:** For Matching, it's recommended not to use more than 7 features as it might result in the curse of
dimensionality, making the results unrepresentative.

### Feature Selection

**Feature selection** models the significance of features for the accuracy of target approximation. However, it does not
rule out the possibility of overlooked features, the complex impact of features on target description, or the
significance of features from a business logic perspective. The algorithm will not function correctly if there are data
leaks.

Points to consider when selecting features:

* Data leaks - these should not be present.
* Influence on treatment distribution - features should not affect the treatment distribution.
* The target should be describable by features.
* All features significantly affecting the target should be included.
* The business rationale of features.
* The feature selection function can be useful for addressing these tasks, but it does not solve them nor does it
  absolve the user of the responsibility for their selection, nor does it justify it.

### Random Treatment

**Random Treatment** algorithm randomly shuffles the actual treatment. It is expected that the treatment's effect on the
target will be close to 0.

These method is not sufficiently accurate marker of a successful experiment.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -U hypex
```

## Quick start

Explore usage examples and tutorials [here](https://github.com/sb-ai-lab/Hypex/blob/master/examples/tutorials/).

### Matching example

```python
from hypex.dataset import Dataset, InfoRole, TreatmentRole, TargetRole, DefaultRole, FeatureRole
from hypex import Matching

data = Dataset(
    roles={
        "user_id": InfoRole(int),  # InfoRole for ID
        "treat": TreatmentRole(int),  # TreatmentRole is for identify user group (control or target)
        "post_spends": TargetRole(float)  # TargetRole for Target :)
    },
    data="data.csv",
    default_role=FeatureRole(),  # All remaining columns will be of type FeatureRole (searching for similar ones)
)

test = Matching()  # Classic Matching (maha distance + full metrics)
test = Matching(metric="att")  # Calc only ATT
test = Matching(distance="l2")  # Choose distance here

result = test.execute(data)
result.resume  # Resume of results 
result.full_data  # old df_matched. Wide df with pairs
result.indexes  # Only indexed pairs (good for join)

```

### AA-test example

```python
from hypex.dataset import Dataset, InfoRole, TreatmentRole, TargetRole, StratificationRole
from hypex import AATest

data = Dataset(
    roles={
        "user_id": InfoRole(int),  # InfoRole for ID.
        "pre_spends": TargetRole(),  # TargetRole for check homogenity
        "post_spends": TargetRole(),  # TargetRole for check homogenity
        "gender": StratificationRole(str)  # StratificationRole for strat
    }, data="data.csv",
)

aa = AATest(n_iterations=10)
res = aa.execute(data)

res.resume  # Resume for all test
res.aa_score  # AA score 
res.best_split  # The best homogeneity split
res.best_split_statistic  # Statistics for best split 
```

### AB-test example

```python
from hypex.dataset import Dataset, InfoRole, TreatmentRole, TargetRole
from hypex import ABTest

data = Dataset(
    roles={
        "user_id": InfoRole(int),  # InfoRole use for ID
        "treat": TreatmentRole(),  # TreatmentRole is for identify user group (control or target)
        "pre_spends": TargetRole(),  # Target for A/B(n) Tests
        "post_spends": TargetRole(),  # Target for A/B(n) Tests
    }, data="data.csv",
)

test = ABTest()  # Classic A/B test
test = ABTest(multitest_method="bonferroni")  # A/Bn test with Bonferroni corrections
test = ABTest(additional_tests=['t-test', 'u-test', 'chi2-test'])  # Use can choose tests

result = test.execute(data)
result.resume  # Resume of results
```
